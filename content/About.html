      <p class="FirstLine"><strong>Apollo Development</strong> is a dev team created in February of 2017. The team consists of 2 developers, zFormulated and</p>
      <p>
RyguyModz. (Site brought to you by zForumlated). Currently, Ryguy and I are in the process of redeveloping Apoll
Engine. We aren't sure how long the first version of Apollo Engine will take but we will keep you updated via our social
media. You can follow me on Instagram <a class="MyIG" href="https://www.instagram.com/xForumModz/">@xForumModz</a> and Ryguy <a class="RyIG" href="https://www.instagram.com/RyguyModz/">@RyguyModz</a>, and subscribe to my <a class="MyYT" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD5h_QRt8a641L3ycdpJ83w">YouTube</a> channel
where I post my menu previews, commentaries, and menu releases (I don't post many videos though). Apollo Team
develops more than just a non-host; we also create GSC Menus and RTM Tools, though we are more focused on the
non-host SPRX at the moment. We strive not only in producing quality projects, but developing with quality source. This is
our way of helping build the coding/developing community and assisting beginners (often referred to as "skids" or "Script
Kiddies") with a quality, easy-to-read source to refer to and learn from. A full project source will be released for each project
after it has been completely finished and is fully functional. Sources will be 100% compile-ready straight from download,
meaning these will be the easiest thing anyone could possibly leech. We are aware of this though we have faith and
encourage you, if you choose to download a source, to strictly use it as a learning tool or reference for your own creations
and to not rely on Apollo Development to provide you with pre-built projects. Our goal is to help the starting community
learn, not leech. For the SPRX, Apollo Engine, it is our first ever non-host SPRX that is for Black Ops 2, and hopefully
a multi-cod SPRX not too long after. In fact, Apollo Engine is what brought the team together and why you are reading this
right now. Development of the Engine started late 2016 and has carried over to a year later where we have decided to start
the development back up and completely redo the menu. It started on Modern Warfare 3 with a pre-built base, because we
have yet to learn how to create bases because we too are beginners ourselves. Some functions were added but we still
weren't satisfied with the results we were getting so we postponed the MW3 development and moved to Black Ops 2,
which is Apollo Engine's current home. We decided on BO2 because we were already so familiar with creating things
for the game that we figured we would be more comfortable and feel more..."at home" forsay. We ended up taking a long,
well-needed break from SPRX and put our minds back to GSC where we're best. Attempting to remake the SPRX-look
as a GSC Menu inspired Ryguy and I to start back up on Apollo Engine SPRX and get back to what we started this great
team for. Unfortunately school, sports and family got in the way and development was put to a hault again, but we are
back and more ready than ever to get back to our passion of coding! If you read this far, thank you for visiting our
Official Site and more importantly, thank you for taking time out of YOUR OWN day to keep us motivated & inspired to
do what we love to do and learn about us. We hope you have a wonderful day. Happy Coding :)
